## 📌 Practice Ideas 

- Create RESTful APIs using Express for each model.
- Implement user registration, login (JWT), and event booking.
- Filter events by date, location, or category.
- Use multer for file uploads (event banners, sponsor logos).
- Handle payments using dummy or real gateways (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe).
